== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does the author box not display on a page? =

The Simple Author Box plugin was designed to display the author information on posts, categories, tags, etc. The plugin does not work on pages – it was not designed for this, unfortunately. Adding the shortcode on a blog page will also not work because the plugin won’t have author information to display/will not know which author information to display. Adding the shortcode in a widget that is on a page is another instance when the SAB will not be displayed due to the same reasons. You can add it in a widget, but that widget has to be on a single post.

= What should I add for Whatsapp ? =

You should add there your phone number, for more information read <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/26000030/" target="_blank">this</a>

= What should I add for Telegram ? =

You should add there your username, for more information read <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-does-t-me-work" target="_blank">this</a>

= Can I remove the SAB from WooCommerce/Category/Tags pages? Can I have only on posts? =

The PRO version of Simple Author Box fixes this.

= Is there any widget in Simple Author Box ? =

Yes, but we also have two awesome widgets in the PRO version.

= I have two author boxes. How can I hide one? =

The second author box might be a theme feature and you will need to turn it off from your theme’s options, or hide it with custom CSS.

= How I can translate the author's biography ? =

You can use 2 plugins in order to do this: Polylang or WPML. Here it is how to translate an author's biography with each plugin:

**Polylang**
When using Polylang a "Biographical Info" textarea is added for each language, this way you can enter the "Biographical Info" for each respective language.

**WPML**
In order to translate the "Biographical Info" using this plugin you have to have the wpml-string-translation plugin installed and the following configurations made:
In the String Translation settings at the bottom you will see a "More options" setting. Click "Edit" then select "Author" from there and finally click "Apply". After this, in the filters above, at "Select strings within domain" select "Authors". This will reveal the strings that can be translated from the author role.

= How can I use it with Content Blocks (Custom Post Widget) ? =

When adding a widget in the widget area you can select the content block to display and there you will also see a checkbox titled "Do not apply content filters". Checking this checkbox will prevent the author box from displaying for that custom post.
When using a shortcode, example [content_block id=41] you can stop the author box from displaying by using one of these shortocodes instead: [content_block id=41 suppress_content_filters=true] or [content_block id=41 suppress_filters=true], both work.

= How can I get support? =

You can get free support either here on the support forums: <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/simple-author-box">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/simple-author-box</a>.
